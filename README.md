## Overview and Origin

Varo Money is a mobile-only neobank. Neobank is an internet-only bank, no physical contact, and physical location. It was founded in 2015 by Colin Walsh and Kolya Klymenko and launched in 2017.  According to an article published by IBS Intelligence, "Varo, the first mobile-centric national bank charter in the U.S." It uses Temenos Transact as its core banking technology." Until June 3, 2020, Varo money raised $419.4 million.  This week, NBA star Russell Westbrook invested around $63 million in Varo money.

##Result

Chime, Current, Space, Cleo, N26, Empower Finance, and Level are some of Varos competitors. Varo is the first and only fully digital bank to receive a national charter, and it has the most ATM access points compared to its competitors. . I believe that money other will follow Russell Westbrook's footstep and invest in Varo. 

The number of customers and brand are some of the metrics used to measure the success of a company. Varo already passed one million customers; this is a huge number for a three years old company. And other celebrities will follow the footsteps of Russel Westbrook and give the brand more news coverage and attract different customers. And also, some of the steps they took to lower banking costs will make them preferable over other traditional banks and competitors. 


##Recommendation

I will advise the company to incorporate securities investment into its service. Recently, the stock market is bringing many first-time investors. According to the wall street journal published on Dec-30-20, "more than 10 million new brokerage accounts were opened" in 2020 alone. Robinhood app was downloaded 500000 times in December. Currently, Robinhood has over 20 million users. And it has a plan to provide a banking service in the future. And it already has tens of millions of customers to start with. Due to the GameStop incident, many individual investors are not happy with Robinhood. Varo should use this to its advantage and start providing securities investment services and draw customers from Robinhood.
